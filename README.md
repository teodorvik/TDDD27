## Project idea
### Minimum viable product
A website where the user can choose what it perfers out of two options, like 
the game "Would you rather". The user can also see what other users have answered.

### Nice to have
* Data analyzis of the answers to create profiles to match against other users which answers is a close match to the current user.
* Create ordered lists from the user/all answers to see what people "would rather"
* User defined questions
* User can create a group of friends to see what they have answered.
* Visualize the data with d3js
